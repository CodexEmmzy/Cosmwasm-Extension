# Features
## CosmWasm Code Snippets

This repository contains a collection of CosmWasm code snippets that provide examples of common entry points and functionality in a CosmWasm smart contract. These snippets can be used as templates to jumpstart your contract development process.

## Snippets

### Instantiate Entry Point

The `instantiate` snippet provides an example of the `instantiate` entry point in a CosmWasm contract. It demonstrates how to initialize the contract upon deployment.

### Query Entry Point

The `query` snippet demonstrates how to implement the `query` entry point in a CosmWasm contract. It showcases how to handle different query messages and provide corresponding responses.

### Execute Entry Point

The `execute` snippet showcases the `execute` entry point in a CosmWasm contract. It demonstrates how to handle different execute messages and their corresponding logic.

### Handle Message Entry Point

The `handle` snippet provides an example of the `handle` entry point in a CosmWasm contract. It shows how to handle various custom message types and respond accordingly.

### Store Data

The `store_data` snippet demonstrates how to store data in the contract's storage using the CosmWasm storage API.

### Read Data

The `read_data` snippet illustrates how to read data from the contract's storage using the CosmWasm storage API.

### Emit Event

The `emit_event` snippet showcases how to emit custom events from a CosmWasm contract. It adds attributes to the emitted event.

### Send Tokens

The `send_tokens` snippet provides an example of how to send tokens from a CosmWasm contract to a specified recipient.

### Condition Check

The `perform_condition_check` snippet demonstrates how to perform a conditional check within a CosmWasm contract and return an error if the condition is not met.

### Query Balance

The `query_balance` snippet shows how to query an account balance using the CosmWasm querier.

### Custom Error

The `custom_error_example` snippet illustrates how to handle custom error cases within a CosmWasm contract.

### Simple Storage

The `simple_storage` snippet provides a basic `instantiate` entry point that stores data in the contract's storage upon deployment.

## Unit Tests

For each entry point and functionality demonstrated above, corresponding unit test cases are provided. These test cases use the `cosmwasm_std::testing` framework to mock dependencies and environments and ensure that the contract behaves as expected.

## Usage

Copy and paste the desired code snippets into your CosmWasm smart contract project. Customize the placeholders and logic according to your project's requirements.
